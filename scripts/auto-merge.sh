# The merge arm, per the locked merge boundary (docs/MERGE-POLICY.md,
# DL-2026-08-25-merge-boundary): maintenance-grade work builds and merges
# itself; Intent-tier decisions and operator-boundary files stay the operator's.
#
# ONE ENGINE, MANY REPOS. Everything below the `janus:merge-config:end`
# sentinel is the shared engine body; the block above it is this repo's
# configuration. Another repo's copy differs only in that block — its
# scripts/test-hooks.sh pins the sha256 of the body against the
# `Engine-sha256:` line in its docs/MERGE-POLICY.md, so a copy that drifts
# from the contract fails its own fixture suite (Policy-version 2).
#
# UNKNOWN IS NOT PERMISSION. Every read that feeds a gate is tri-state: the
# payload, or a failure sentinel that the gate turns into a HOLD with the
# reason on the report line. A read that cannot be completed never becomes
# "none exist" — that is exactly how the previous engine let a failed
# changed-file listing skip the boundary gate and a failed human-check listing
# read as "no human is looking" (audit 2026-09-02, overlord#275 D1/D2).
#
#   - Eligibility is by HEAD PREFIX (allowlist in the config block); `intent/`
#     and `heartbeat/` are never eligible; an unknown prefix is skipped loudly.
#   - A linked `Closes #N` issue must be open, not Intent-tier, and free of
#     gating labels; LINKED_ISSUE=required makes the link itself mandatory and
#     LINKED_ISSUE_KINDS names the title prefixes / labels that make it eligible.
#   - The PR's own labels gate too: `machinery-change` (a human decided this
#     needs a human — DL-2026-09-01-v2-build-merge), `question:`, `loop:hold`,
#     `human-check:`, `intent:`, `goal:`.
#   - A diff touching an operator-boundary file self-merges only when every
#     changed line is a positively-recognised tightening with nothing removed
#     (R1, MERGE-POLICY rule 2). The classifier reads ONE `gh pr diff` per PR
#     and slices the per-file hunk; an unreadable diff or hunk is operator-only.
#     The changed-file list comes from the paginated files API and must match
#     the PR's own `changedFiles` count, or the PR holds.
#   - Identity is NOT a signal: agent sessions push under the operator's login,
#     so an author allowlist cannot tell hand-typed from agent-opened. No
#     author gate exists (MERGE-POLICY.md, "identity is not a signal").
#   - `mergeStateStatus` BLOCKED / BEHIND / UNKNOWN and `reviewDecision`
#     REVIEW_REQUIRED hold: an engine merges, it never approves (L-116).
#   - The merge itself is pinned to the head SHA the gates read
#     (`--match-head-commit`): a push between read and act fails the merge,
#     never the gate.
#
# State lives in the PR's own lifecycle comments (MARKER): a rerun against an
# unchanged head SHA is a no-op; a new push is eligible again. Conflicting
# eligible PRs get one rebase-request comment per head SHA; PRs held on a
# policy verdict get one "Action: held" comment per head SHA (overlord-ui
# surfaces it). Holds caused by an unreadable read post NO comment — they are
# transient and already on the report line; a comment per outage would spam.
#
# Exit status: 0 after a complete pass (every PR has a report line, holds
# included); 1 when a RUN-LEVEL read failed (repo, open-PR list, human-check
# list, label set) — nothing was decided, and the workflow goes red so the
# outage is visible instead of reading as "nothing to do".
#
# --dry-run: print one line per PR ("<num>\t<action>\t<reason>"), mutate
# nothing. --probe: report whether this token can see checks at all (one line,
# exit 1 when it cannot) — the capability canary for the scope failure that
# blanked overlord-ui's arm for weeks. scripts/test-hooks.sh drives all three
# modes with a stubbed gh, including injected read failures.
