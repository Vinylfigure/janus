#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Stack-agnostic verification dispatcher. /bootstrap fills in the real commands.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify.sh quick [file]   # fast per-file check (<10s): format/lint/typecheck
#   scripts/verify.sh full           # the whole truth: tests + build (+ graph refresh)
#
# Contract:
# - `quick` is wired to the PostToolUse hook: it must be FAST and exit nonzero
#   with useful output on failure (the agent sees stderr and iterates).
# - `full` is the closed loop for /verify-loop and the verifier agent: exit 0
#   means the project is genuinely healthy.
# - Until /bootstrap runs, quick checks only the scaffold's own plumbing
#   (*.sh syntax, *.json validity) and full runs the fixture suite; app code
#   passes untouched, so the template stays quiet out of the box.
