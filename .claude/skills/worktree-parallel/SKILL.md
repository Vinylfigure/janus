description: Fan a task out into parallel Claude Code sessions, each in its own git worktree, then merge tracks after each verifies green. Use for independent workstreams - refactor + feature + bugfix concurrently.

argument-hint: [task to parallelize]
---

Parallel sessions multiply throughput only when the tracks are genuinely
independent and each track closes its own verification loop before merging.
Worktrees share the repo's `.claude/` (it's in-tree), so every parallel
session gets the same skills, hooks, and memory for free.

## Hold in mind

1. Tracks must be independent: no two tracks editing the same files, or the merge eats the savings.
2. One task per session: a session's context is one workspace — never multiplex tracks in one conversation; 3–5 concurrent sessions is the practical sweet spot.
3. Each track verifies green in its own worktree before any merge.
4. Worktrees are disposable; branches carry the work. Clean up after merging.

## Steps

1. Split the task into independent tracks. For each, write one paragraph: scope, files it will touch, its "done means" check. If two tracks overlap on files, merge them into one track.
2. Launch each track in its own worktree:
   - **Native path (preferred)**: `claude --worktree <slug>` — Claude Code creates and manages the worktree itself (add `--tmux` to give each its own tmux session/pane).
   - **Fallback** (older CLI versions): `scripts/new-worktree.sh create <slug>` creates `../<repo>-wt-<slug>` on branch `wt/<slug>`, then start `claude` there manually.
   - Subagent-level equivalent: an agent with `isolation: worktree` frontmatter runs in its own worktree — use for delegated parallel edits inside one session.
3. Give each session its kickoff prompt: the track's scope paragraph, its "done means" check, and the instruction to run `/verify-loop` before declaring done.
4. Monitor the fleet: number your terminal tabs per track and enable system notifications so you know when a session needs input; `claude agents` from the root directory shows all concurrent sessions grouped by status.
5. Merge protocol, once tracks report green:
   - In the main checkout, merge each track's branch one at a time, running `scripts/verify.sh full` after each merge.
   - On conflict or post-merge red: fix in the main checkout before merging the next track.
6. Cleanup: remove each merged track's worktree (`scripts/new-worktree.sh clean <slug>` for script-created trees; `git worktree remove` + branch delete for native ones).

## Before finishing

List each track, its branch, and its verification evidence. Confirm
`verify.sh full` is green on the merged result and all worktrees are cleaned.
