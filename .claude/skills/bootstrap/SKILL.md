description: Specialize this Janus scaffold to a real tech stack - detect or ask for the stack, wire scripts/verify.sh to real lint/test commands, update the project facts in CLAUDE.md, and prove the verification loop closes. Use when the project facts say NOT BOOTSTRAPPED or when adopting Janus into an existing codebase.
argument-hint: [optional stack hint, e.g. "python uv" or "node pnpm"]

Turns the stack-agnostic template into a project that verifies itself. The
hooks and skills only start earning their keep once `verify.sh` runs real
commands — this skill wires that up and proves it.

## Hold in mind

1. Hooks only help if wired to real commands — placeholder checks are worse than none because they teach false confidence.
2. `verify.sh quick` runs after every single edit: it must finish in well under 10 seconds or it will be resented and disabled.
3. `verify.sh full` is the definition of "healthy": if it passes while the project is broken, every loop built on it is lying.
4. CLAUDE.md's concept budget applies to the facts you write: stack, commands, run instructions — one line each.

## Steps

1. Detect the stack: look for manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `mix.exs`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.csproj`). Use the argument as a hint. If nothing is found (fresh project), interview the user: language, package manager, test framework, formatter/linter. Scaffold the minimal stack files they choose.
2. Wire `scripts/verify.sh`:
   - Replace the block between `# janus:bootstrap:quick:start` and `:end` with per-file checks keyed on file extension (format check, lint, typecheck of the changed file). Budget: <10s.
   - Replace the block between `# janus:bootstrap:full:start` and `:end` with the real suite: lint all, typecheck all, tests, build if applicable.
3. Offer the Graphify knowledge-graph layer (optional, skip cleanly if declined or `uv` is unavailable):
   - `uv tool install graphifyy && graphify install`, then `graphify .` to build the initial graph.
   - If installed, append to the `full` arm: `command -v graphify >/dev/null 2>&1 && graphify . --quiet` so the graph never goes stale.
4. Rewrite the block between `<!-- janus:facts:start -->` and `<!-- janus:facts:end -->` in CLAUDE.md: stack + package manager; how to run verify (quick/full); how to run the app; knowledge-graph line if Graphify was installed ("Query the graph before grepping: `graphify query` or MCP `query_graph`").
5. Prove the loop closes, both ways:
   - Run `scripts/verify.sh full` — must exit 0 on the healthy project.
   - Make a deliberately bad edit to a real source file (e.g. introduce a syntax error), confirm `scripts/verify.sh quick <file>` exits nonzero with useful output, then revert the edit.
6. If this project was replicated from a parent, review inherited entries in `.claude/memory/LEARNINGS.md` (`Status: inherited`): any that are stack-relevant here get re-marked `candidate` so `/evolve` can promote them.

## Before finishing

Paste: the passing `verify.sh full` output, and the failing-then-reverted
quick-check output proving the PostToolUse hook will bite. State the new
facts block verbatim and confirm CLAUDE.md is still within its concept budget.
